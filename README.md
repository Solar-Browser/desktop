# Solar Browser
Solar for desktop is a Python based web browser. It uses QtWebEngine. I want to do a web engine in future with Python. If I can do, I will use it instead of this. Probably in 1.0 or later versions, I will publish the C++ version of Solar Browser too.
In C++ version I will use Firefox's Web Engine (Gecko) instead of Chromium based web engine. Thanks for your support!

# How to run?
This is for if there isn't any release in releases tab and web site of Solar Browser. Also for developers.
First of all, you need to install Python to your computer. You can install it from: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
In Windows, tick the install pip in setup configuration. We will install packages with pip. After install of Python open terminal. Write those;

pip install PyQt5
pip install PyQtWebEngine

When these are finished, you can run the desktop.py or you can build.
